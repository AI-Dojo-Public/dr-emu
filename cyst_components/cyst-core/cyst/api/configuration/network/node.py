    A network node is a main building block of simulation topology. It is modelled as a collection of services and a
    set of network interfaces.

    :param shell: A name of a passive service that is designated as a shell. Properties of the shell service determine
        the impact of some exploits, e.g., when related to access rights. Technically, any name could be selected as a
        shell, because the system currently does not check whether the service exists or not.
